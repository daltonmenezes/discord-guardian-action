# Features
- 洟窶，reates/updates domain list from different providers
- 笨ｨ窶、ccepts your own maintained list file to be joined in the **domains.json**
- 汨坂、ccepts the custom filename and directory to save the domain list

# Usage
As your app will consume the **domains.json**, it's recommended to you create an empty one with an empty array just to be filled when this action run, so your application can import this file without any problem.

**Example:** At **src/data** path in your repository, create a **domains.json** with the following content:

```js
[]
```

And your workflow file should look like the following:

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    # At minute 0 past every 5th hour
    # https://crontab.guru/#0_*/5_*_*_*
    - cron: "0 */5 * * *"

jobs:
  discord_guardian_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Discord Guardian Job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Discord Guardian Action
        uses: actions/discord-guardian-action@v1.1.0
        id: discord
        with:
          name: 'Your Name'
          email: 'your_email@domain.com'
          directory: src/data
```
Now, when this action runs for the first time, the **domains.json** will be filled. 衍ｳ
